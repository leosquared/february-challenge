# "February Challenge", a data exercise.

### Tech Specs
- Scripts and Jupyter Notebooks are executed in *Python 3.6*
- Python dependencies can be found in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/leosquared/february-challenge/blob/master/requirements.txt)
- Local database is *PostgreSQL 10.2*, and local credentials are saved in a YAML file, omitted in this repo

### Scripts & Outputs
- [Data Exploration Notebook](https://github.com/leosquared/february-challenge/blob/master/data-files-exploration.ipynb) is a short exploration to get a glimpse of the files
- [psql_etl.py](https://github.com/leosquared/february-challenge/blob/master/psql_etl.py) is a script to perform all of the ETL tasks specified in the challenge, including filling in blank columns
- [Analysis & Visualization Notebook](https://github.com/leosquared/february-challenge/blob/master/analysis-visualization.ipynb) is a series of scripts aimed at gaining data insights around customer purchasing behavior and the loyalty program, incuding the visualizations used in the presentation
- [This presentation](https://github.com/leosquared/february-challenge/blob/master/Customer%20Purchase%20Insights.pdf) contains the initial insights into the loyalty program and overall customer purchasing trends, including visualizations generated by the previous notebook

### Assumptions
- The numeric values in *value* columns are assumed to be in cents
- The *standard points* column in the customers file is assumed to be the **current** number of points the customer has. This value would change dynamically as more transactions occur.

### Further Considerations
- This analytics effort is built to be a prototype. If the project is to scale, there are a few suggested changes:
	- Instead of a local database, perform the ETL on a cloud-based data warehouse such as AWS Redshift
	- Perform scheduled script runs (such as cron) which allows for regular updates of aggregate stats and proper reporting tables
	- Perform regular indexing of reporting tables to optimize query performance
	- Connect queries to a dashboard designed in collaboration with the users
	- Establish regular monitoring system to ensure data completeness and quality
- Several other data points would be helpful, especially in improving model accuracy:
	- Other personal information on the customer, such as email domains, names, and acquisition source
	- Purchase item category and label
- Suggested next steps on the loyalty program:
	- Design experiments aimed at minimizing drop off rates between purchases
	- Implement different levels of points, with potentially larger discounts, since current "revenue loss" is a small fraction
	- Test various campaigns to raise awareness of points programs
